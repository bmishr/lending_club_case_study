# Lending club case study
> The project aims to use exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key variables driving loan defaults for the largest online loan marketplace. Understanding these factors helps in reducing credit losses and improving risk assessment. Relevant aspects of risk analytics include assessing credit risk through demographic and credit history variables, predictive modeling using machine learning, understanding feature importance, optimizing loan portfolios, and ensuring regulatory compliance.
